[Try it here!](https://idolize.github.io/redux-requests)

> Click to load data for a user, and watch the network requests in your browser dev tools:
> no new requests will be made for the same URL while there is already a request for that URL in flight
> (the request is delayed by 5 seconds to better illustrate the point)
